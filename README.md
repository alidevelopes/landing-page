# landing-page

This my first landing page, made from scratch. This is an attempt of copying the design provided by The Odin Project curriculum in the Foundation section (Project Landing Page).

The hardest part was making/styling the layout part (ofc). I mainly used flexbox for the layout and positioning, and tried avoiding adding grid or anything similar (not that i know them, not yet anyway). This is just to test the limits of mu understanding of flexbox. 

I still have a long way to go but, the
things that I learned by completing this project are: 
    - how to think when it comes to using flexbox, especially about the main and cross axes when it comes positiong different boxes.

    In addition to this, I also 
    - got a bit more familiar with using git, git-commit and push. Still learning.
